<p>Before we move on to anything else, let’s revisit some of the things we’ve done in the first four chapters. We have:</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Learned about concepts from the world of physics — What is a vector? What is a force? What is a wave? etc.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Understood the math and algorithms behind such concepts.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Implemented the algorithms in Processing with an object-oriented approach.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>These activities have yielded a set of motion simulation examples, allowing us to creatively define the physics of the worlds we build (whether realistic or fantastical).  Of course, we aren’t the first to try this. The world of computer graphics and programming is full of source code dedicated to simulation. Just try Googling “open-source physics engine” and you could spend the rest of your day pouring over rich and complex code.    And so we must ask the question: If a code library will take care of physics simulation, why should we bother learning how to write any of the algorithms ourselves?</p>
<p>Here is where the philosophy behind this book comes into play.  While many of the libraries out there give us physics (and super awesome advanced physics at that) for free, there are significant reasons for learning the fundamentals from scratch before diving into libraries. First, without an understanding of vectors, forces, and trigonometry, we’d be completely lost just reading the documentation of a library.   Second, even though a library may take care of the math for us, it won’t necessarily simplify our code.  As we’ll see in a moment, there can be a great deal of overhead in simply understanding how a library works and what it expects from you code-wise.  Finally, as wonderful as a physics engine might be, if you look deep down into your hearts, it’s likely that you seek to create worlds and visualizations that stretch the limits of imagination. A library is great, but it provides a limited set of features. It’s important to know both when to live within limitations in the pursuit of a Processing project and when those limits prove to be confining.</p>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to examining two open-source physics libraries—Box2D and toxiclibs’ VerletPhysics engine.   With each library, we’ll evaluate its pros and cons and look at reasons why you might choose one of these libraries for a given project.</p>
<section><a id="chapter05_section1" style="display: block;"></a><h3 id="51-what-is-box2d-and-when-is-it-useful">5.1 What Is Box2D and When Is It Useful?</h3><p><a id="angry-birds-82690c20-253f-0130-bbc6-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="box2d-82691ab0-253f-0130-bbc7-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="catto-erin-82692870-253f-0130-bbc8-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="crayon-physics-826937a0-253f-0130-bbc9-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="physics-librariesbox2d-82695110-253f-0130-bbca-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Box2D began as a set of physics tutorials written in C++ by Erin Catto for the Game Developer’s Conference in 2006. Over the last five years it has evolved into an rich and elaborate open-source physics engine.   It’s been used for countless projects, most notably highly successful games such as the award-winning puzzle game Crayon Physics and the runaway mobile and tablet hit Angry Birds.</p>
<p><a id="box2doverhead-with-826974f0-253f-0130-bbcb-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>One of the key things to realize about Box2D is that it is a true physics engine.  Box2D knows nothing about computer graphics and the world of pixels; it is simply a library that takes in numbers and spits out more numbers. And what are those numbers?  Meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.  All of Box2D’s measurements and calculations are for real-world measurements—only its “world” is a two-dimensional plane with top, bottom, left, and right edges.  You tell it things like: “The gravity of our world is 9.81 newtons per kilogram, and a circle with a radius of four meters and a mass of fifty kilograms is located ten meters above the world’s bottom.”   Box2D will then tell you things like: “One second later, the rectangle is at five meters from the bottom; two seconds later, it is ten meters below,” etc.  While this provides for an amazing and realistic physics engine, it also necessitates lots of complicated code in order to translate back and forth between the physics “world” (a key term in Box2D) and the world we want to draw on —the “pixel” world of Processing.</p>
<p>So when is it worth it to have this additional overhead?  If I just want to simulate a circle falling down a Processing window with gravity, do I really need to write all the extra Box2D code just to get that effect?  Certainly, the answer is no.  We saw how to do this rather easily in the first chapter of this book.    Let’s consider another scenario.  What if I want to have a hundred of those circles falling?  And what if those circles aren’t circles at all, but irregularly shaped polygons?  And what if I want these polygons to bounce off each other in a realistic manner when they collide?</p>
<p><a id="collisions-82699080-253f-0130-bbcc-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="physicscollisions-8269a500-253f-0130-bbcd-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>You may have noticed that the first four chapters of this book, while covering motion and forces in detail, has skipped over a rather important aspect of physics simulation—<em>collisions</em>.   Let’s pretend for a moment that you aren’t reading a chapter about libraries and that we decided right now to cover how to handle collisions in a particle system.   We’d have to evaluate and learn two distinct algorithms that address these questions:</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
How do I determine if two shapes are colliding (i.e. intersecting)?
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
How do I determine the shapes’ velocity after the collision?
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>If we’re thinking about shapes like rectangles or circles, question #1 isn’t too tough.  You’ve likely encountered this before.  For example, we know two circles are intersecting if the distance between them is less than the sum of their radii.</p>
<a id="chapter05_figure1" style="display: block;"></a><div class="image-container " >
	
	<img src="/book/imgs/chapter05/ch05_01.png" alt="Nature of Code Image" />
	
	<p class="caption">Figure 5.1</p>
</div>
<p>OK. Now that we know how to determine if two circles are colliding, how do we calculate their velocities after the collision?   This is where we’re going to stop our discussion.   Why, you ask?  It’s not that understanding the math behind collisions isn’t important or valuable.  (In fact, I’m including additional examples on the website related to collisions without a physics library.)  The reason for stopping is that life is short (let this also be a reason for you to consider going outside and frolicking instead of programming altogether).  We can’t expect to master every detail of physics simulation.  And while we could continue this discussion for circles, it’s only going to lead us to wanting to work with rectangles.  And strangely shaped polygons.  And curved surfaces.  And swinging pendulums colliding with springy springs.  And and and and and.</p>
<p>Working with collisions in our Processing sketch while still having time to spend with our friends and family—that’s the reason for this chapter.   Erin Catto spent years developing solutions to these kinds of problems so you don’t need to engineer them yourselves, at least for now.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you find yourself describing an idea for a Processing sketch and the word “collisions” comes up, then it’s likely time to learn Box2D.   (We’ll also encounter other words that might lead you down this path to Box2D, such as “joint,” “hinge,” “pulley,” “motor,” etc.)</p>
</section><section><a id="chapter05_section2" style="display: block;"></a><h3 id="52-getting-box2d-in-processing">5.2 Getting Box2D in Processing</h3><p><a id="box2dprocessing-and-8269e750-253f-0130-bbce-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="processingbox2d-and-8269fa30-253f-0130-bbcf-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>So, if Box2D is a physics engine that knows nothing about pixel-based computer graphics and is written in C++, how are we supposed to use it in Processing?</p>
<p><a id="box2djbox2d-and-826a10d0-253f-0130-bbd0-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="java-826a2370-253f-0130-bbd1-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="jbox2d-826a3110-253f-0130-bbd2-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="processingjbox2d-826a4000-253f-0130-bbd3-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>The good news is that Box2D is such an amazing and useful library that everyone wants to use it—Flash, Javascript, Python, Ruby programmers.  Oh, and Java programmers.  There is something called JBox2D, a Java port of Box2D.  And because Processing is built on top of Java, JBox2D can be used directly in Processing!</p>
<p>So here’s where we are so far.</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ul>
		
			<li><p><a href="http://www.box2d.org/">Box2D site</a> for reference.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><a href="http://www.jbox2d.org/">JBox2D site</a> for Processing compatibility.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ul>
</div><p><a id="box2dpbox2d-helper-class-826a6c90-253f-0130-bbd4-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="pbox2d-helper-class-826a8d00-253f-0130-bbd5-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>This is all you need to get started writing Box2D code in Processing.  However, as we are going to see in a moment, there are several pieces of functionality we’ll repeatedly need in our Processing code, and so it’s worth having one additional layer between our sketches and JBox2D.  I’m calling this PBox2D—a Processing Box2D “helper” library included as part of this book’s code example downloads.</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ul>
		
			<li><p><a href="http://github.com/shiffman/PBox2D">PBox2D GitHub repository</a></p>
</li>
		
	</ul>
</div><p>It’s important to realize that PBox2D is not a Processing wrapper for all of Box2D.   After all, Box2D is a thoughtfully organized and well-structured API and there’s no reason to take it apart and re-implement it.  However, it’s useful to have a small set of functions that help you get your Box2D world set up, as well as help you figure out where to draw your Box2D shapes.  And this is what PBox2D will provide.</p>
<p><a id="box2dfisica-826ab9c0-253f-0130-bbd6-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="fisica-826acc40-253f-0130-bbd7-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="marxer-ricard-826ae230-253f-0130-bbd8-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>I should also mention before we move forward that there are other Processing libraries that wrap Box2D for you. One I would recommend taking a look at is <a href="http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/">Fisica</a> by Ricard Marxer.</p>
</section><section><a id="chapter05_section3" style="display: block;"></a><h3 id="53-box2d-basics">5.3 Box2D Basics</h3><p><a id="box2dusage-826b0900-253f-0130-bbd9-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Do not despair! We really are going to get to the code very soon, and in some ways we’ll blow our previous work out of the water.  But before we’re ready to do that, it’s important to walk through the overall process of using Box2D in Processing.   Let’s begin by writing a pseudocode generalization of all of our examples in Chapters 1 through 4.</p>
<p><strong><em>SETUP:</em></strong></p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Create all the objects in our world.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p><strong><em>DRAW:</em></strong></p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Calculate all the forces in our world.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Apply all the forces to our objects (F = M * A).
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Update the locations of all the objects based on their acceleration.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Draw all of our objects.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>Great.  Let’s rewrite this pseudocode as it will appear in our Box2D examples.</p>
<p><strong><em>SETUP:</em></strong></p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Create all the objects in our world.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p><strong><em>DRAW:</em></strong></p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Draw all of our objects.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>This, of course, is the fantasy of Box2D.  We’ve eliminated all of those painful steps of figuring out how the objects are moving according to velocity and acceleration.  Box2D is going to take care of this for us!   The good news is that this does accurately reflect the overall process.  Let’s imagine Box2D as a magic box.</p>
<p>In <span class="function">setup()</span>, we’re going to say to Box2D: “Hello there. Here are all of the things I want in my world.”  In <span class="function">draw()</span>, we’re going to politely ask Box2D: “Oh, hello again. If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to draw all of those things in my world.  Could you tell me where they are?”</p>
<p>The bad news: it’s not as simple as the above explanation would lead you to believe.   For one, making the stuff that goes in the Box2D world involves wading through the documentation for how different kinds of shapes are built and configured.  Second, we have to remember that we can’t tell Box2D anything about pixels, as it will simply get confused and fall apart.  Before we tell Box2D what we want in our world, we have to convert our pixel units to Box2D “world” units.  And the same is true when it comes time to draw our stuff. Box2D is going to tell us the location of the things in its world, which we then have to translate for the pixel world.</p>
<div class="list">
	
		<h4>SETUP</h4>
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Create everything that lives in our pixel world.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Translate the pixel world into the Box2D world.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><div class="list">
	
		<h4>DRAW</h4>
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p>
Ask Box2D where everything is.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Translate Box2D’s answer into the pixel world.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p>
Draw everything.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>Now that we understand that anything we create in our Processing sketch has to be placed into the Box2D world, let’s look at an overview of the elements that make up that world.</p>
<p><a id="body-box2d-element-826e6100-253f-0130-bbda-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="box2dcore-elements-826e7140-253f-0130-bbdb-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="fixture-box2d-element-826e84a0-253f-0130-bbdc-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="joint-box2d-element-826e9530-253f-0130-bbdd-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="shape-box2d-element-826ea740-253f-0130-bbde-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="vec2-box2d-element-826eb690-253f-0130-bbdf-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="vectorsvec2-box2d-element-826ec6c0-253f-0130-bbe0-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="world-class-box2d-826ed920-253f-0130-bbe1-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<div class="list">
	
		<h4>Core elements of a Box2D world:</h4>
	
	<ol class="arabic">
		
			<li><p><strong><em>World</em></strong>: Manages the physics simulation.  It knows everything about the overall coordinate space and also stores lists of every element in the world (see 2-4 below).
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Body</em></strong>: Serves as the primary element in the Box2D world. It has a location. It has a velocity. Sound familiar? The <span class="klass">Body</span> is essentially the class we’ve been writing on our own in our vectors and forces examples.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Shape</em></strong>: Keeps track of all the necessary collision geometry attached to a body.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Fixture</em></strong>:  Attaches a shape to a body and sets properties such as density, friction, and restitution.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Joint</em></strong>: Acts as a connection between two bodies (or between one body and the world itself).
</p>
</li>
		
	</ol>
</div><p>In the next four sections, we are going to walk through each of the above elements in detail, building several examples along the way.   But first there is one other important element we should briefly discuss.</p>
<p>          6.   <strong><em>Vec2</em></strong>: Describes a vector in the Box2D world.</p>
<p>And so here we are, arriving with trepidation at an unfortunate truth in the world of using physics libraries.   Any physics simulation is going to involve the concept of a vector.  This is the good part.  After all, we just spent several chapters familiarizing ourselves with what it means to describe motion and forces with vectors.   We don’t have to learn anything new conceptually.</p>
<p><a id="box2dpvector-vs-826f4c00-253f-0130-bbe2-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="pvector-class-processingbox2d-vs-826f6b60-253f-0130-bbe3-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Now for the part that makes the single tear fall from my eye: we don’t get to use <span class="klass">PVector</span>. It’s nice that Processing has <span class="klass">PVector</span> for us, but anytime you use a physics library you will probably discover that the library includes its own vector implementation.  This makes sense, after all; why should Box2D be expected to know about <span class="klass">PVector</span>?   And in many cases, the physics engine will want to implement a vector class in a specific way so that it is especially compatible with the rest of the library’s code.   So while we don’t have to learn anything new conceptually, we do have to get used to some new naming conventions and syntax.

<p>As you can see, the concepts are the same, but the function names and the arguments are slightly different.  For example, instead of static and non-static <span class="function">add()</span> and <span class="function">mult()</span>, if a <span class="klass">Vec2</span> is altered, the word “local” is included in the function name—<span class="function">addLocal()</span>, <span class="function">multLocal()</span>.</p>
<p>We’ll cover the basics of what you need to know here, but if you are looking for more, full documentation of <span class="klass">Vec2</span> can be found by downloading the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jbox2d/">JBox2D source code</a>.</p>

<p>The Box2D <span class="klass">World</span> object is in charge of everything. It manages the coordinate space of the world, all of the stuff that lives in the world, and decides when time moves forward in the world.</p>

<p>In order to have Box2D as part of our Processing sketches, the <span class="klass">World</span> is the very first thing that needs to be set up.  Here is where PBox2D comes in handy and takes care of making the world for us.</p>

  <div style="position: relative;clear:both;display:block;height:1px;width:100%;"></div>
</div><p>It’s worth noting that gravity doesn’t have to be fixed, nor does it always have to point downwards; you can adjust the gravity vector while your program is running.  Gravity can be turned off by setting it to a (0,0) vector.</p>
<p>So, what are those numbers 0 and -10?   This should remind us of one of the most important details of using Box2D: the Box2D coordinate system is not your pixel coordinate system!   Let’s look at how Box2D and a Processing window think differently of their worlds.</p>

</div>
<p>Notice how in Box2D <em>(0,0)</em> is in the center and <em>up</em> is the positive direction along the y-axis!   Box2D’s coordinate system is just like that lovely old-fashioned Cartesian one with <em>(0,0)</em> in the center and <em>up</em> pointing in a positive direction.  Processing, on the other hand, uses a traditional computer graphics coordinate system where <em>(0,0)</em> is in the top left corner and <em>down</em> is the positive direction along the y-axis.  This is why if we want objects to fall down with gravity, we need to give Box2D a gravity force with a negative y-value.</p>

</div><p>Luckily for us, if we prefer to think in terms of pixel coordinates (which as Processing programmers, we are likely to do), PBox2D offers a series of helper functions that convert between pixel space and Box2D space.  Before we move onto the next section and begin creating Box2D bodies, let’s take a look at how these helper functions work.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to tell Box2D where the mouse is in its world.  We know the mouse is located at <span class="var">(mouseX,mouseY)</span> in Processing.  To convert it, we say we want to convert a “coordinate” from “pixels” to “world”—<span class="function">coordPixelsToWorld()</span>.  Or:</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>

</table><p>There are also additional functions that allow you to pass or receive a <span class="klass">PVector</span> when translating back and forth, but since we are only working with Box2D in the examples in this chapter, it’s easiest to stick with the <span class="klass">Vec2</span> class for all vectors.</p>
<p>Once the world is initialized, we are ready to actually put stuff in the world—Box2D bodies.</p>
</section><section><a id="chapter05_section5" style="display: block;"></a><h3 id="55-building-a-box2d-body">5.5 Building a Box2D Body</h3><p><a id="body-box2d-elementbuilding-82723670-253f-0130-bbf8-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>A Box2D body is the primary element in the Box2D world.  It’s the equivalent to the <span class="klass">Mover</span> class we built on our own in previous chapters—the thing that moves around the space and experiences forces. It can also be static (meaning fixed and not moving). It’s important to note, however, that a body has no geometry; it isn’t anything physical.   Rather, bodies have Box2D shapes attached to them. (This way, a body can be a single rectangle or a rectangle attached to a circle, etc.) We’ll look at shapes in a moment; first, let’s build a body.</p>
<section><a id="_step_1_define_a_body" style="display: block;"></a><h4 id="step-1-define-a-body">Step 1:  Define a body.</h4><p><a id="body-box2d-elementbodydef-type-82725b00-253f-0130-bbf9-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="bodydef-type-body-element-82726cb0-253f-0130-bbfa-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>The first thing we have to do is create a “body definition.” This will let us define the properties of the body we intend to make.  This may seem a bit awkward at first, but it’s how Box2D is structured.  Anytime you want to make a “thing,” you have to make a “thing definition” first.  This will hold true for bodies, shapes, and joints.</p>

</div><p>Danger, danger!  I’m not going to address this with every single example, but it’s important to at least point out the perilous path we are taking with the above line of code.  Remember, if we are going to tell Box2D where we want the body to start, we must give Box2D a world coordinate!  Yes, we want to think of its location in terms of pixels, but Box2D doesn’t care.  And so before we pass that position to the body definition, we must make sure to use one of our helper conversion functions.</p>

<p>The body definition must also specify the “type” of body we want to make.  There are three possibilities:</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ul>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Dynamic.</em></strong>  This is what we will use most often—a “fully simulated” body.  A dynamic body moves around the world, collides with other bodies, and responds to the forces in its environment.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Static.</em></strong> A static body is one that cannot move (as if it had an infinite mass).  We’ll use static bodies for fixed platforms and boundaries.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>Kinematic.</em></strong>  A kinematic body can be moved manually by setting its velocity directly.  If you have a user-controlled object in your world, you can use a kinematic body.   Note that kinematic bodies collide only with dynamic bodies and not with other static or kinematic ones.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ul>
</div><p>There are several other properties you can set in the body definition.  For example, if you want your body to have a fixed rotation (i.e. never rotate), you can say:</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>

</div>
  <div style="position: relative;clear:both;display:block;height:1px;width:100%;"></div>
</div><p>You can also set a value for linear or angular damping, so that the object continuously slows as if there is friction.</p>

<p>In addition, fast-moving objects in Box2D should be set as bullets.  This tells the Box2D engine that the object may move very quickly and to check its collisions more carefully so that it doesn’t accidentally jump over another body.</p>

<p>A body on its own doesn’t physically exist in the world. It’s like a soul with no human form to inhabit. For a body to have mass, we must first define a shape and attach that shape to the body with something known as a fixture.</p>
<p><a id="shape-box2d-elementfriction-attribute-8273ec00-253f-0130-bc05-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="shape-box2d-elementrestitution-attribute-82740720-253f-0130-bc06-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>The job of the Box2D <span class="klass">Shape</span> class is to keep track of all the necessary collision geometry attached to a body.  A shape also has several important properties that affect the body’s motion.  There is density, which ultimately determines that body’s mass.  Shapes also have <em>friction</em> and <em>restitution</em> (“bounciness”) which will be defined through a fixture. One of the nice things about Box2D’s methodology, which separates the concepts of bodies and shapes into two separate objects, is that you can attach multiple shapes to a single body in order to create more complex forms.  We’ll see this in a future example.</p>
<p>To create a shape, we need to first decide what kind of shape we want to make.  For most non-circular shapes, a <span class="klass">PolygonShape</span> object will work just fine. For example, let’s look at how we define a rectangle.</p>

<p>The shape and body are made as two separate entities.  In order to attach a shape to a body, we must make a fixture.   A fixture is created, just as with the body, via a fixture definition (i.e. <span class="klass">FixtureDef</span> class) and assigned a shape.</p>

Box2D will always know it’s there, check it for collisions, move it appropriately according to the forces, etc. It’ll do all that for you without you having to lift a finger! What it won’t do, however, is display the body for you. This is a good thing. This is your time to shine. When working with Box2D, what we’re essentially saying is, “I want to be the designer of my world, and I want you, Box2D, to compute all the physics.”</p>
<p><a id="body-lists-maintaining-in-processing-827570e0-253f-0130-bc0c-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="getbodylist-function-world-class-827580d0-253f-0130-bc0d-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="processingbody-lists-maintaining-82759190-253f-0130-bc0e-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="world-class-box2dgetbodylist-function-8275a680-253f-0130-bc0f-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Now, Box2D will keep a list of all the bodies that exist in the world. This can be accessed by calling the World object’s <span class="function">getBodyList()</span> function. Nevertheless, what I’m going to demonstrate here is a technique for keeping your own body lists. Yes, this may be a bit redundant and we perhaps sacrifice a bit of efficiency. But we more than make up for that with ease of use. This methodology will allow us to program like we’re used to in Processing, and we can easily keep track of which bodies are which and render them appropriately. Let’s consider the structure of the following Processing sketch:</p>
<a id="chapter05_figure3" style="display: block;"></a><div class="image-container " >
	
	<img src="/book/imgs/chapter05/ch05_03.png" alt="Nature of Code Image" />
	
	<p class="caption">Figure 5.3</p>
</div>
<p>This looks like any ol’ Processing sketch. We have a main tab called “Boxes” and a “Boundary” and a “Box” tab. Let’s think about the Box tab for a moment. The Box tab is where we will write a simple class to describe a <span class="klass">Box</span> object, a rectangular body in our world.</p>

</div><p>Now, here’s our assignment. Take the above example verbatim, but instead of drawing fixed boxes on the screen, draw boxes that experience physics (via Box2D) as soon as they appear.</p>
<p>We’ll need two major steps to accomplish our goal.</p>

<p>This part is not too tough.  We saw this already in our discussion of building a Box2D world.  This is taken care of for us by the PBox2D helper class.  We can create a PBox2D object and initialize it in <span class="function">setup()</span>.</p>
<div class="source-code">

<p>Then in <span class="function">draw()</span>, we need to make sure we call one very important function: <span class="function">step()</span>. Without this function, nothing would ever happen! <span class="function">step()</span> advances the Box2D world a step further in time. Internally, Box2D sweeps through and looks at all of the Bodies and figures out what to do with them. Just calling <span class="function">step()</span> on its own moves the Box2D world forward with default settings; however, it is customizable (and this is documented in the PBox2D source).</p>

<p>But now Box2D manages the object’s motion, so we can no longer use our own variables to display the shape. Not to fear! Our <span class="klass">Box</span> object has a reference to the Box2D body associated with it. So all we need to do is politely ask the body, “Pardon me, where are you located?” Since this is a task we’ll need to do quite often, PBox2D includes a helper function: <span class="function">getBodyPixelCoord()</span>.</p>

Note, however, that the Box2D coordinate system considers rotation in the opposite direction from Processing, so we need to multiply the angle by -1.</p>

<p>In this chapter’s code downloads, find the sketch named “box2d_exercise.”  Using the methodology outlined in this chapter, add the necessary code to the main and Box tabs to implement Box2D physics.  The result should appear as in the screenshot above.   Be more creative in how you render the boxes.</p>

<p>In the example we just created, the <span class="klass">Box</span> objects appear at the mouse location and fall downwards due to Box2D’s default gravity force.  What if we wanted to install some immovable boundaries in the Box2D world that would block the path of the <span class="klass">Box</span> objects (as in the illustration below)?</p>
<p>Box2D makes this easy for us by providing a means to lock a body (and any associated shapes) in place.   Just set the <span class="klass">BodyDef</span> object’s type to <span class="var">STATIC</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="klass">ChainShape</span> object is a series of connected vertices.  To create the chain, we must first specify an array of vertices (each as a <span class="klass">Vec2</span> object).  For example, if we wanted a straight line from the left-hand side of our window to the right-hand side, we would just need an array of two vertices: (0,150) and (width,150).  (Note that if you want to create a loop where the first vertex connects to the last vertex in a loop, you can use the <span class="klass">ChainLoop</span> class instead.)</p>

<p>Now that we’ve seen how easy it is to make simple geometric forms in Box2D, let’s imagine that you want to have a more complex form, such as a little alien stick figure.</p>
<p>There are two strategies in Box2D for making forms that are more advanced than a basic circle or square.   One is to use a <span class="klass">PolygonShape</span> in a different way.  In our previous examples, we used <span class="klass">PolygonShape</span> to generate a rectangular shape with the <span class="function">setAsBox()</span> function.</p>

<p>This was a good way to start because of the inherent simplicity of working with rectangles.  However, a <span class="klass">PolygonShape</span> object can also be generated from an array of vectors, which allows you to build a completely custom shape as a series of connected vertices.  This works very similarly to the <span class="klass">ChainShape</span> class.</p>

			<li><p><strong>Order of vertices!</strong>  If you are thinking in terms of pixels (as above) the vertices should be defined in counterclockwise order.  (When they are translated to Box2D World vectors, they will actually be in clockwise order since the vertical axis is flipped.)
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong>Convex shapes only!</strong>  A concave shape is one where the surface curves inward. Convex is the opposite (see illustration below).  Note how in a concave shape every internal angle must be 180 degrees or less.  Box2D is not capable of handling collisions for concave shapes.  If you need a concave shape, you will have to build one out of multiple convex shapes (more about that in a moment).

<p>Now, when it comes time to display the shape in Processing, we can no longer just use <span class="function">rect()</span> or <span class="function">ellipse()</span>.  Since the shape is built out of custom vertices, we’ll want to use Processing’s <span class="function">beginShape()</span>, <span class="function">endShape()</span>, and <span class="function">vertex()</span> functions.   As we saw with the <span class="klass">ChainShape</span>, we could choose to store the pixel locations of the vertices in our own <span class="klass">ArrayList</span> for drawing.  However, it’s also useful to see how we can ask Box2D to report back to use the vertex locations.</p>

<p>A polygon shape will get us pretty far in Box2D.  Nevertheless, the convex shape requirement will severely limit the range of possibilities.  The good news is that we can completely eliminate this restriction by creating a single Box2D body out of multiple shapes!  Let’s return to our little alien creature and simplify the shape to be a thin rectangle with a circle on top.</p>
<p>How can we build a single body with two shapes?  Let’s first review how we built a single body with one shape.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:  Define the body.</em><br /><em>Step 2: Create the body.</em><br /><strong><em>Step 3: Define the shape.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 4: Attach the shape to the body.</em></strong><br /><em>Step 5: Finalize the body’s mass.</em></p>
<p>Attaching more than one shape to a body is as simple as repeating steps 3 and 4 over and over again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3a: Define shape 1.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 4a: Attach shape 1 to the body.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 3b: Define shape 2.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 4b: Attach shape 2 to the body.</em></strong><br />
etc. etc. etc.<br /></p>
<p>Let’s see what this would look like with actual Box2D code.</p>

<p>When you attach a shape to a body, by default, the center of the shape will be located at the center of the body.  But in our case, if we take the center of the rectangle to be the center of the body, we want the center of the circle to be offset along the y-axis from the body’s center.</p>

</div><p>Finishing off this section, I want to stress the following: the stuff you draw in your Processing window doesn’t magically experience physics simply because we created some Box2D bodies and shapes.  These examples work because we very carefully matched how we draw our elements with how we defined the bodies and shapes we put into the Box2D world.   If you accidentally draw your shape differently, you won’t get an error, not from Processing or from Box2D.  However, your sketch will look odd and the physics won’t work correctly.  For example, what if we had written:</p>

<p>The results would look like the image above, where clearly, the collisions are not functioning as expected.  This is not because the physics is broken; it’s because we did not communicate properly with Box2D, either when we put stuff in the magic world or queried the world for locations.</p>

<p>Box2D joints allow you to connect one body to another, enabling more advanced simulations of swinging pendulums, elastic bridges, squishy characters, wheels spinning on an axle, etc.  There are many different kinds of Box2D joints. In this chapter we’re going to look at three: distance joints, revolute joints, and “mouse” joints.</p>
<p><a id="distance-joints-82810890-253f-0130-bc29-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="joint-box2d-elementdistance-82811c70-253f-0130-bc2a-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Let’s begin with a distance joint, a joint that connects two bodies with a fixed length.  The joint is attached to each body at a specified anchor point (a point relative to the body’s center).  For any Box2D joint, we need to follow these steps.  This, of course, is similar to the methodology we used to build bodies and shapes, with some quirks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1. Make sure you have two bodies ready to go.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 2. Define the joint.</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 3. Configure the joint’s properties (What are the bodies? Where are the anchors? What is its rest length? Is it elastic or rigid?)</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Step 4. Create the joint.</em></strong><br /></p>
<p>Let’s assume we have two <span class="klass">Particle</span> objects that each store a reference to a Box2D <span class="klass">Body</span> object.  We’ll call them particles <span class="var">p1</span> and <span class="var">p2</span>.</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>
  <textarea>Particle p1 = new Particle();
Particle p2 = new Particle();</textarea>

<p>OK, onto Step 2.  Let’s define the joint.</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>
  <textarea>DistanceJointDef djd = new DistanceJointDef();</textarea>

</div>
  <div style="position: relative;clear:both;display:block;height:1px;width:100%;"></div>
</div><p>Easy, right?  Now it’s time to configure the joint.   First we tell the joint which two bodies it connects:</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>
  <textarea>djd.bodyA = p1.body;

<p>Then we set up a rest length.  Remember, if our rest length is in pixels, we need to convert it!</p>
<div class="source-code">

Assign a density of zero to lock the endpoints in place.  Experiment with different values to make the bridge more or less “springy.”   It should also be noted that the joints themselves have no physical geometry, so in order for your bridge not to have holes, spacing between the nodes will be important.</p>

<p>Another joint you can create in Box2D is a <em>revolute joint</em>. A revolute joint connects two Box2D bodies at a common anchor point, which can also be referred to as a “hinge.”   The joint has an “angle” that describes the relative rotation of each body.   To use a revolute joint, we follow the same steps we did with the distance joint.</p>

<p>The most important properties of a revolute joint are the two bodies it connects as well as their mutual anchor point (i.e. where they are connected).   They are set with the function <span class="function">initialize()</span>.</p>

<p>The last joint we’ll look at is a mouse joint.  A mouse joint is typically used for moving a body with the mouse.  However, it can also be used to drag an object around the screen according to some arbitrary <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.   The joint functions by pulling the body towards a “target” position.</p>
<p><a id="mouse-joint-box2d-joint-typesettransform-function-8283e340-253f-0130-bc35-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="settransform-function-box2d-8283fbd0-253f-0130-bc36-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Before we look at the <span class="klass">MouseJoint</span> object itself, let’s ask ourselves why we even need it in the first place.  If you look at the Box2D documentation, there is a function called <span class="function">setTransform()</span> that specifically “sets the position of the body’s origin and rotation (radians).”  If a body has a position, can’t we just assign the body’s position to the mouse?</p>

</div><p>While this will in fact move the body, it will also have the unfortunate result of breaking the physics.  Let’s imagine you built a teleportation machine that allows you to teleport from your bedroom to your kitchen (good for late-night snacking).   Now, go ahead and rewrite Newton’s laws of motion to account for the possibility of teleportation.  Not so easy, right?  Box2D has the same problem.  If you manually assign the location of an body, it’s like saying “teleport that body” and Box2D no longer knows how to compute the physics properly.  However, Box2D does allow you to tie a rope to yourself and get a friend of yours to stand in the kitchen and drag you there.  This is what the <span class="klass">MouseJoint</span> does. It’s like a string you attach to a body and pull towards a target.</p>
<p>Let’s look at making this joint, assuming we have a <span class="klass">Box</span> object called <span class="var">box</span>.  This code will look identical to our distance joint with one small difference.</p>

</div><p>Well, as we’ve stated, a joint is a connection between <em>two</em> bodies.  With a mouse joint, we’re saying that the second body is, well, the ground.  Hmm.  What the heck is the <em>ground</em> in Box2D?   One way to imagine it is to think of the screen as the ground.  What we’re doing is making a joint that connects a rectangle drawn on the window with the Processing window itself.  And the point in the window to which the connection is tied is a moving target.</p>
<p>Once we have a mouse joint, we’ll want to update the target location continually while the sketch is running.</p>

<p>If we want to use any of our Chapter 2 techniques with Box2D, we need look no further than our trusty <span class="function">applyForce()</span> function.   In our <span class="klass">Mover</span> class we wrote a function called <span class="function">applyForce()</span>, which received a vector, divided it by mass, and accumulated it into the mover’s acceleration.  With Box2D, the same function exists, but we don’t need to write it ourselves.  Instead, we can call the Box2D body’s <span class="function">applyForce()</span> function!</p>

</div><p>Here we are receiving a force vector and passing it along to the Box2D <span class="klass">Body</span> object.  The key difference is that Box2D is a more sophisticated engine than our examples from Chapter 2.   Our earlier forces examples assumed that the force was always applied at the mover’s center.  Here we get to specify exactly where on the body the force is applied.  In the above code, we’re just applying it to the center by asking the body for its center, but this could be adjusted.</p>
<p>Let’s say we wanted to use a gravitational attraction force.  Remember the code we wrote back in Chapter 2 in our <span class="klass">Attractor</span> class?</p>

<p>Now we’ve seen a survey of what can be done with Box2D.   Since this book is not called “The Nature of Box2D,” it’s not my intention to cover every single possible feature of the Box2D engine.  But hopefully by looking at the basics of building bodies, shapes, and joints, when it comes time to use an aspect of Box2D that we haven’t covered, the skills we’ve gained here will make that process considerably less painful.  There is one more feature of Box2D, however, that I do think is worth covering.</p>
<p>Let’s ask a question you’ve likely been wondering about:</p>
<p><em>What if I want something to happen when two Box2D bodies collide?   I mean, don’t get me wrong—I’m thrilled that Box2D is handling all of the collisions for me. But if it takes care of everything for me, how am I supposed to know when things are happening?</em></p>
<p>Your first thoughts when considering an event during which two objects collide might be as follows:  Well, if I know all the bodies in the system, and I know where they are all located, then I can just start comparing the locations, see which ones are intersecting, and determine that they’ve collided.  That’s a nice thought, but hello??!?  The whole point of using Box2D is that Box2D will take care of that for us.  If we are going to do the geometry to test for intersection ourselves, then all we’re doing is re-implementing Box2D.</p>
<p><a id="contactlistener-class-jbox2d-82865940-253f-0130-bc3c-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="interfaces-82867280-253f-0130-bc3d-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="jbox2dcontactlistener-class-82868cc0-253f-0130-bc3e-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Of course, Box2D has thought of this problem before.  It’s a pretty common one.  After all, if you intend to make a bajillion dollars selling some game called Angry Birds, you better well make something happen when an ill-tempered pigeon smashes into a cardboard box.   Box2D alerts you to moments of collision with something called an “interface.”  It’s worth learning about interfaces, an advanced feature of object-oriented programming. You can take a look at the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html">Java Interface Tutorial</a> as well as the JBox2D <span class="klass">ContactListener</span> class. (I have also included an example on the website that demonstrates using the interface directly.)</p>
<p><a id="begincontact-function-pbox2d-8286c8f0-253f-0130-bc3f-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="collisionsbegincontact-function-pbox2d-8286e580-253f-0130-bc40-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>If you are using PBox2D, as we are here, you don’t need to implement your own interface.  Detecting collision events is done through a callback function.  Much like <span class="function">mousePressed()</span> is triggered when the mouse is pressed, <span class="function">beginContact()</span> is triggered when two shapes collide.</p>

<p>Notice that the function above includes an argument of type <span class="klass">Contact</span>.  A <span class="klass">Contact</span> object includes all the data associated with a collision—the geometry and the forces.  Let’s say we have a Processing sketch with <span class="klass">Particle</span> objects that store a reference to a Box2D body.    Here is the process we are going to follow.</p>

Is it the bodies?  The shapes? The fixtures?   Box2D detects collisions between shapes; after all, these are the entities that have geometry.  However, because shapes are attached to bodies with fixtures, what we really want to ask Box2D is: “Could you tell me which two fixtures collided?”</p>

After all, Box2D doesn’t know anything about our code.  Sure, it is doing all sorts of stuff to keep track of the relationships between shapes and bodies and joints, but it’s up to us to manage our own objects and their associations with Box2D elements.   Luckily for us, Box2D provides a function that allows us to attach our Processing object (a <span class="klass">Particle</span>) to a Box2D body via the <span class="function">setUserData()</span> and <span class="function">getUserData()</span> methods.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the constructor in our <span class="klass">Particle</span> class where the body is made.   We are expanding our body-making procedure by one line of code, noted below.</p>

<p>Has the following ever happened to you?  You’re at a fancy cocktail party regaling your friends with tall tales of software physics simulations.   Someone pipes up: “Enchanting! But what integration method are you using?”  “What?!” you think to yourself.  “Integration?”</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve heard the term before.  Along with “differentiation,” it’s one of the two main operations in calculus.  Right, calculus.  The good news is, we’ve gotten through about 90% of the material in this book related to physics simulation and we haven’t really needed to dive into calculus.  But as we’re coming close to finishing this topic, it’s worth taking a moment to examine the calculus behind what we have been doing and how it relates to the methodology in certain physics libraries (like Box2D and the upcoming toxiclibs).</p>
<p><a id="derivatives-828c5f40-253f-0130-bc46-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="differentiation-828c7050-253f-0130-bc47-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>Let’s begin by answering the question: “What does integration have to do with location, velocity, and acceleration?”   Well, first let’s define <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>, the process of finding a “derivative.”  The derivative of a function is a measure of how a function changes over time.  Consider location and its derivative.  Location is a point in space, while velocity is change in location over time.  Therefore, velocity can be described as the “derivative” of location.   What is acceleration?  The change in velocity over time—i.e. the “derivative” of velocity.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the derivative (differentiation), we can define the integral (integration) as the inverse of the derivative.  In other words, the integral of an object’s velocity over time tells us the object’s new location when that time period ends.   Location is the integral of velocity, and velocity is the integral of acceleration.  Since our physics simulation is founded upon the process of calculating acceleration based on forces, we need integration to figure out where the object is after a certain period of time (like one frame of animation!)</p>
<p>So we’ve been doing integration all along!  It looks like this:</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>

<p>The above methodology is known as Euler integration (named for the mathematician Leonhard Euler, pronounced “Oiler”) or the Euler method.    It’s essentially the simplest form of integration and very easy to implement in our code (see the two lines above!)  However, it is not necessarily the most efficient form, nor is it close to being the most accurate.    Why is Euler inaccurate?  Let’s think about it this way.  When you drive a car down the road pressing the gas pedal with your foot and accelerating, does the car sit in one location at time equals one second, then disappear and suddenly reappear in a new location at time equals two seconds, and do the same thing for three seconds, and four, and five?  No, of course not.  The car moves continuously down the road.  But what’s happening in our Processing sketch?  A circle is at one location at frame 0, another at frame 1, another at frame 2.  Sure, at thirty frames per second, we’re seeing the illusion of motion.  But we only calculate a new location every <span class="var">N</span> units of time, whereas the real world is perfectly continuous.   This results in some inaccuracies, as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<a id="chapter05_figure13" style="display: block;"></a><div class="image-container " >
	
	<img src="/book/imgs/chapter05/ch05_13.png" alt="Nature of Code Image" />
	
	<p class="caption">Figure 5.13</p>
</div>
<p>The “real world” is the curve; Euler simulation is the series of line segments.</p>
<p>One option to improve on Euler is to use smaller timesteps—instead of once per frame, we could recalculate an object’s location twenty times per frame.  But this isn’t practical; our sketch would then run too slowly.</p>
<p><a id="euler-integrationsymplectic-euler-box2d-828d0d70-253f-0130-bc4b-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="symplectic-euler-box2d-828d2390-253f-0130-bc4c-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>I still believe that Euler is the best method for learning the basics, and it’s also perfectly adequate for most of the projects we might make in Processing.  Anything we lose in efficiency or inaccuracy we make up in ease of use and understandability.    For better accuracy, Box2D uses something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_Euler_method">symplectic Euler or semi-explicit Euler</a>, a slight modification of Euler.</p>
<p><a id="integrationrunge-kutta-method-828d4530-253f-0130-bc4d-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="kutta-m-w-828d6030-253f-0130-bc4e-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="runge-c-828d7640-253f-0130-bc4f-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="runge-kutta-method-828d8c20-253f-0130-bc50-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>There is also an integration method called Runge-Kutta (named for German mathematicians C. Runge and M. W. Kutta), which is used in some physics engines.</p>
<p><a id="particle-systemsverlet-integration-and-828da3a0-253f-0130-bc51-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="verlet-integration-828db990-253f-0130-bc52-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>A very popular integration method that our next physics library uses is known as “Verlet integration.”  A simple way to describe Verlet integration is to think of our typical motion algorithm without velocity.  After all, we don’t really need to store the velocity.  If we always know where an object was at one point in time and where it is now, we can extrapolate its velocity.  Verlet integration does precisely this, though instead of having a variable for velocity, it calculates velocity while the program is running.   Verlet integration is particularly well suited for particle systems, especially particle systems with spring connections between the particles.    We don’t need to worry about the details because toxiclibs, as we’ll see below, takes care of them for us.  However, if you are interested, here is the seminal paper on Verlet physics, from which just about every Verlet computer graphics simulation is derived: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030121/jacobson_pfv.htm">"Advanced Character Physics"</a>. And of course, you can find out more about Verlet integration from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>From toxiclibs.org:</p>
<p><em>“toxiclibs is an independent, open source library collection for computational design tasks with Java & Processing developed by Karsten “toxi” Schmidt (thus far). The classes are purposefully kept fairly generic in order to maximize re-use in different contexts ranging from generative design, animation, interaction/interface design, data visualization to architecture and digital fabrication, use as teaching tool and more.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, we should thank our lucky stars for toxiclibs.  We are only going to focus on a few examples related to Verlet physics, but toxiclibs includes a suite of other wonderful packages that help with audio, color, geometry, and more.  In particular, if you are looking to work with form and fabrication in Processing, take a look at the geometry package.   Demos can be found at <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/portal/?userID=4530">Open Processing</a>.</p>
<p>We should note that toxiclibs was designed specifically for use with Processing.  This is great news.  The trouble we had with making Box2D work in Processing (multiple coordinate systems, Box2D vs. JBox2D vs. PBox2D) is not an issue here.  toxiclibs is a library that you just download, stick in your libraries folder, and use.  And the coordinate system that we’ll use for the physics engine is the coordinate system of Processing, so no translating back and forth.   In addition, toxiclibs is not limited to a 2D world; all of the physics simulations and functions work in both two and three dimensions.  So how do you decide which library you should use?  Box2D or toxiclibs?  If you fall into one of the following two categories, your decision is a bit easier:</p>
<p><a id="box2dtoxiclibs-vs-828e43e0-253f-0130-bc57-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="collisionstoxiclibs-and-828e55f0-253f-0130-bc58-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="toxiclibsbox2d-vs-828e7100-253f-0130-bc59-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. My project involves collisions.   I have circles, squares, and other strangely shaped objects that knock each other around and bounce off each other.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, you are going to need Box2D.  toxiclibs does not handle collisions.</p>
<p><strong>2. My project involves lots of particles flying around the screen.  Sometimes they attract each other.  Sometimes they repel each other.  And sometimes they are connected with springs.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, toxiclibs is likely your best choice.  It is simpler to use than Box2D and particularly well suited to connected systems of particles.  toxiclibs is also very high performance, due to the speed of the Verlet integration algorithm (not to mention the fact that the program gets to ignore all of the collision geometry).</p>

<p>Here we go again.  Remember all that time we spent learning the ins and outs of the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class?  Then remember how when we got to Box2D, we had to translate all those concepts to a Box2D vector class: <span class="klass">Vec2</span>?  Well, it’s time to do it again.  toxiclibs also includes its own vector classes, one for two dimensions and one for three:  <span class="klass">Vec2D</span> and <span class="klass">Vec3D</span>.</p>
<p>Again, toxiclibs vectors are the same conceptually, but we need to learn a bit of new syntax.  You can find all of the documentation for these vector classes here:</p>
<p><a href="http://toxiclibs.org/docs/core/toxi/geom/Vec2D.html">Vec2D</a><br /><a href="http://toxiclibs.org/docs/core/toxi/geom/Vec3D.html">Vec3D</a></p>
<p>And let’s just review some of the basic vector math operations with <span class="klass">PVector</span> translated to <span class="klass">Vec2D</span> (we’re sticking with 2D for simplicity’s sake).</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do to create a toxiclibs physics world in our examples is import the library itself.</p>

<p>Then we’ll need a reference to our physics world, a <span class="klass">VerletPhysics</span> or <span class="klass">VerletPhysics2D</span> object (depending on whether we are working in two or three dimensions).  The examples in this chapter will operate in 2D only for simplicity, but they could easily be extended into 3D (and 3D versions are available with the chapter download).</p>

<p>In addition, you can add gravity to the physics world with a <span class="klass">GravityBehavior</span> object.  A gravity behavior requires a vector—how strong and in what direction is the gravity?</p>

<p>In the Box2D examples, we saw how we can create our own class (called, say, <span class="klass">Particle</span>) and include a reference to a Box2D body.</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>

</div>
  <div style="position: relative;clear:both;display:block;height:1px;width:100%;"></div>
</div><p>This technique is somewhat redundant since Box2D itself keeps track of all of the bodies in its world.  However, it allows us to manage which body is which (and therefore how each body is drawn) without having to rely on iterating through Box2D’s internal lists.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how we might take the same approach with the class <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span> in toxiclibs. We want to make our own <span class="klass">Particle</span> class so that we can draw our particles a certain way and include any custom properties. We’d probably write our code as follows:</p>
<div class="source-code">
  <a class="toggle" href="#" data-to-raw='Show Raw' data-to-formatted='Show Formatted'>Show Raw</a>
  <textarea>class Particle {
  // Our Particle has a reference to a VerletParticle.
  VerletParticle2D p;

  Particle(Vec2D pos) {
    // A VerletParticle needs an initial location (an x and y).
    p = new VerletParticle2D(pos);
  }

  void display() {
    fill(0,150);
    stroke(0);
    // When it comes time to draw the Particle, we ask the
    // VerletParticle for its x and y coordinates.
    ellipse(p.x,p.y,16,16);

</div><p>Looking at the above, we should first be thrilled to notice that drawing the particle is as simple as grabbing the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> and using them.  No awkward conversions between coordinate systems here since toxiclibs is designed to think in pixels.    Second, you might notice that this <span class="klass">Particle</span> class’s sole purpose is to store a reference to a <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span> object.  This hints at something.  Remember our discussion of inheritance back in Chapter 4: Particle Systems? What is a <span class="klass">Particle</span> object other than an “augmented” <span class="klass">VerletParticle</span>?  Why bother making a Verlet particle inside a particle when we could simply <span class="klass">extend VerletParticle</span>?</p>

</div><p>Remember our multi-step process with the Box2D examples?  We had to ask the body for its location, then convert that location to pixels, then use that location in a drawing function.  Now, because we have inherited everything from the <span class="klass">VerletParticle</span> class, our only step is to draw the shape at <span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span>!</p>

<p>Incidentally, it’s interesting to note that the <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span> class is a subclass of <span class="klass">Vec2D</span>. So in addition to inheriting everything from <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span>, our <span class="klass">Particle</span> class actually has all of the <span class="klass">Vec2D</span> functions available as well.</p>
<p>We can now create particles anywhere within our sketch.</p>

</div><p>If you look at the toxiclibs documentation, you’ll see that the <span class="function">addParticle()</span> expects a <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span> object.</p>
<p><span class="function">addParticle(VerletParticle2D particle)</span></p>
<p>And how can we then pass into the function our own <span class="klass">Particle</span> object?   Remember that other tenet of object-oriented programming—polymorphism? Here, because our <span class="klass">Particle</span> class <span class="klass">extends VerletParticle2D</span>, we can choose to treat our particle in two different ways—as a <span class="klass">Particle</span> or as a <span class="klass">VerletParticle2D</span>.   This is an incredibly powerful feature of object-oriented programming.  If we build our custom classes based on classes from toxiclibs, we can use our objects in conjunction with all of the functions toxiclibs has to offer.</p>

<p>In addition to the <span class="klass">VerletParticle</span> class, toxiclibs has a set of classes that allow you to connect particles with spring forces.  There are three types of springs in toxiclibs:</p>
<p><a id="springsverletconstrainedspring-class-toxiclibs-829657c0-253f-0130-bc70-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="springsverletmindistancespring-class-toxiclibs-82966ac0-253f-0130-bc71-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="springsverletspring-class-toxiclibs-82968c30-253f-0130-bc72-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="verletconstrainedspring-class-toxiclibs-8296a620-253f-0130-bc73-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="verletmindistancespring-class-toxiclibs-8296b6b0-253f-0130-bc74-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="verletspring-class-toxiclibs-8296c4f0-253f-0130-bc75-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ul>
		
			<li><p><span class="klass">VerletSpring</span>: This class creates a springy connection between two particles in space. A spring’s properties can be configured in such a way as to create a stiff stick-like connection or a highly elastic stretchy connection. A particle can also be locked so that only one end of the spring can move.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><span class="klass">VerletConstrainedSpring</span>: A <span class="klass">VerletConstrainedSpring</span> object is a spring whose maximum distance can be limited. This can help the whole spring system achieve better stability.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><span class="klass">VerletMinDistanceSpring</span>: A <span class="klass">VerletMinDistanceSpring</span> object is a spring that only enforces its rest length if the current distance is less than its rest length. This is handy if you want to ensure objects are at least a certain distance from each other, but don’t care if the distance is bigger than the enforced minimum.
</p>
</li>
		
	</ul>
</div><p>The inheritance and polymorphism technique we employed in the previous section also proves to be useful when creating springs. A spring expects two particles when it is created. And again, because our <span class="klass">Particle</span> class <span class="klass">extends VerletParticle</span>, a <span class="klass">VerletSpring</span> object will accept our <span class="klass">Particle</span> objects passed into the constructor.  Let’s take a look at some example code that assumes the existence of our two previous particles <span class="var">p1</span> and <span class="var">p2</span> and creates a connection between them with a given rest length and strength.</p>

<p>One thing we saw with Box2D is that the physics simulation broke down when we overrode it and manually set the location of a body. With toxiclibs, we don’t have this problem.  If we want to move the location of a particle, we can simply set its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> location manually.  However, before we do so, it’s generally a good idea to call the <span class="function">lock()</span> function.</p>
<p><span class="function">lock()</span> is typically used to lock a particle in place and is identical to setting a Box2D body’s density to 0.   However, here we are going to show how to lock a particle temporarily, move it, and then unlock it so that it continues to move according to the physics simulation.
 Let’s say you want to move a given particle whenever you click the mouse.</p>

One particle is locked in place, and the other can be moved by dragging the mouse.  Note that this example is virtually identical to <a href="#chapter03_example11">Example 3.11</a>.</p>

<p>The above example, two particles connected with a single spring, is the core building block for what toxiclibs’ physics is particularly well suited for: soft body simulations.  For example, a string can be simulated by connecting a line of particles with springs.  A blanket can be simulated by connecting a grid of particles with springs.  And a cute, cuddly, squishy cartoon character can be simulated by a custom layout of particles connected with springs.</p>

<p>Have you ever encountered the following scenario?</p>
<p>“I have a whole bunch of stuff I want to draw on the screen and I want all that stuff to be spaced out evenly in a nice, neat, organized manner.  Otherwise I have trouble sleeping at night.”</p>
<p>This is not an uncommon problem in computational design. One solution is typically referred to as a “force-directed graph.”  A force-directed graph is a visualization of elements—let’s call them “nodes”—in which the positions of those nodes are not manually assigned. Rather, the nodes arrange themselves according to a set of forces.  While any forces can be used, a typical example involves spring forces.  And so toxiclibs is perfect for this scenario.</p>

If we ran the sketch as is, nothing would happen. Why? Because we forgot the whole force-directed graph part!  We need to connect every single node to every other node with a force. But what exactly do we mean by that?  Let’s assume we have four <span class="klass">Node</span> objects: 0, 1, 2 and 3.  Here are our connections:</p>
<p><span class="mono">0 connected to 1<br />
0 connected to 2<br />
0 connected to 3<br />
1 connected to 2<br />
1 connected to 3<br />
2 connected to 3</span></p>
<p>Notice two important details about our connection list.</p>
<div class="list">
	
	<ul>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>No node is connected to itself.</em></strong>  We don’t have 0 connected to 0 or 1 connected to 1.
</p>
</li>
		
			<li><p><strong><em>We don’t need to repeat connections in reverse.</em></strong>  In other words, if we’ve already said 0 is connected to 1, we don’t need to say 1 is connected to 0 because, well, it already is!
</p>
</li>
		
	</ul>
</div><p>So how do we write code to make these connections for <em>N</em> number of nodes?</p>
<p>Look at the left column. It reads: 000 11 22.  So we know we need to access each node in the list from 0 to <em>N</em>-1.</p>

<p>When we looked at adding an attraction force to Box2D, we found that the Box2D <span class="klass">Body</span> class included an <span class="function">applyForce()</span> function.  All we needed to do was calculate the attraction force (Force = G * mass1 * mass2 / distance squared) as a vector and apply it to the body.  toxiclibs <span class="klass">VerletParticle</span> class also includes a function called <span class="function">addForce()</span> that we can use to apply any calculated force to a particle.</p>
<p><a id="attractionbehavior-class-toxiclibs-829d39e0-253f-0130-bc80-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a><a id="toxiclibsattractionbehavior-class-829d4ad0-253f-0130-bc81-7cd1c3f718ad" style="display: block;"></a></p>
<p>However, toxiclibs also takes this idea one step further by allowing us to attach some common forces (let’s call them “behaviors”) to particles, calculating them and applying them for us!  For example, if we attach an <span class="klass">AttractionBehavior</span> object to a particle, then all other particles in the physics world will be attracted to that particle.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a <span class="klass">Particle</span> class (that <span class="klass">extends VerletParticle</span>).</p>

</div><p>Notice how the behavior is created with two parameters—<span class="var">distance</span> and <span class="var">strength</span>.  The distance specifies the range within which the behavior will be applied.  For example, in the above scenario, only other particles within twenty pixels will feel the attraction force.  The strength, of course, specifies how strong the force is.</p>
<p>Finally, in order for the force to be activated, the behavior needs to be added to the physics world.</p>

</div><p>This means everything that lives in the physics simulation will always be attracted to that particle, as long as it is within the distance threshold.</p>
<p>Even though toxiclibs does not handle collisions, you can create a collision-like effect by adding a repulsive behavior to each and every particle (so that every particle repels every other particle).  Let’s look at how we might modify our <span class="klass">Particle</span> class to do this.</p>
